# Debugging Remove Button Issue

## Steps to Debug

1. **Open Developer Console**
   - In the Settings window, right-click and select "Inspect Element" or "Developer Tools"
   - Go to the Console tab

2. **Try to Remove a Target**
   - Click the "Remove" button on any target
   - Look for these console messages:
     - `Removing target: [target-id]`
     - `Remove cancelled` (if you clicked Cancel)
     - `Before remove, targets: [number]`
     - `After remove, targets: [number]`

3. **Check for Errors**
   - Look for any red error messages in the console
   - Common issues might be:
     - JavaScript errors
     - Permission issues with confirm dialog
     - Target ID not being passed correctly

## What Should Happen

1. Click "Remove" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure you want to remove this target?"
3. If you click OK:
   - Target is removed from the list
   - UI updates immediately
   - "Save Changes" button becomes active
4. If you click Cancel:
   - Nothing happens, target stays

## Possible Issues

1. **Confirm Dialog Blocked**: Some Tauri configurations might block confirm dialogs
2. **Target ID Issue**: The target ID might not be passed correctly
3. **State Not Updating**: The UI might not be re-rendering after removal

## Alternative Fix

If the confirm dialog is the issue, I can implement a custom confirmation modal instead of using the browser's confirm() function.
