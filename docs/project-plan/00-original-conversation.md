**User**

i want to build a project: the scenarios are: its too much of a hassle getting a syncing call with your partner, you have to find a time that syncs with both parties, then open a bunch of stuff, share video meeting link, then join.

What i want to do is to create a macos/windows/linux app to be able to press a global hotkey that sits on the operating system layer, and then automatically without any sign in or create an account or anything, just start a video meeting with your partner. which automatically creates or joins a meeting. The same  hotkey command pressed will disconnect from the meeting. The partner can press a configurable set of hot keys to do the same, automatically joins or creates a meeting, configured to their partner. these are global hot keys which would wor\"k without needing to open a app or sign into zoom or google meets, or any of that. Just simplify. 3 key strokes and straight to meeting


we want to use tauri, and jitsi for a working product first, and we ideally dont want to pay for anything for this initial working product

the inital product should be cross compatible

regurgitate that info to me, be extremely detailed, so i know we are on the same page, then ask any clarifying questions

### Restated product vision (extremely detailed)
- You want a cross‑platform desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux) that lives at the OS level.
- The app registers global hotkeys so it works regardless of which app is in focus.
- Primary UX:
  - Press a single configured global hotkey combo (3 keys) to immediately start or join a 1‑to‑1 video meeting with your partner.
  - No sign‑in, no account creation, no copy/paste, no opening Zoom/Meet/etc.
  - The same hotkey toggles: if in a meeting → disconnect and close; if not in a meeting → join/create.
- Partner flow mirrors yours: their app is configured with your pairing info and their own hotkey(s). Pressing their hotkey joins/creates the same meeting and connects the two of you.
- Implementation choices:
  - Use Tauri for the app shell (small, native, cross‑platform, Rust backend + webview frontend).
  - Use Jitsi for video conferencing (free via `meet.jit.si`; no accounts required).
- Target outcome: 3 keystrokes → you’re both in a call. Zero friction, zero setup during use.
- Cost: ideally $0 for the MVP (Tauri and meet.jit.si are free).
- Scope: initial product, keep it simple, cross‑compatible out of the box.

### Core behavior and flow
- App runs in the background with a tray/dock/menu bar presence so the hotkey works without opening a visible window first.
- Press global hotkey:
  - If not connected: app opens a minimal always‑on‑top window with a Jitsi meeting and auto‑joins the partner room (created if it doesn’t exist).
  - If connected: app leaves the meeting and closes/hides the window.
- The “room selection” is automatic and deterministic so both ends land in the same place (no manual exchange needed each time).
- No pre‑join or intermediate steps unless permissions (camera/mic) require an OS prompt.

### Assumptions about “partner configuration”
- Each user configures one primary partner (MVP). Optionally more partners later via additional hotkeys (e.g., one hotkey per partner).
- The meeting room name is derived deterministically from a shared pairing secret/code so both sides always join the same Jitsi room without coordination.
- The room persists on Jitsi; first one in creates it, second joins. Timing doesn’t need to be simultaneous.

### Technical approach (high‑level)
- App
  - Tauri app with a system‑tray/background process and autostart (optional).
  - Global hotkeys registered via Tauri’s global shortcut API/plugin.
  - Minimal UI window that embeds Jitsi via iFrame API (within the Tauri webview) and skips the pre‑join screen.
- Jitsi
  - Use public `https://meet.jit.si/<derived-room-id>` for free usage, anonymous join.
  - Configure defaults via iFrame API: auto‑join, mic/cam on/off defaults, display name, skip welcome.
  - Optional: enable E2EE in supported browsers/webviews if desired (with constraints).
- Room derivation
  - Deterministic room ID: e.g., `pair-<hash(partnerSecret)>` where `partnerSecret` is a short shared code set during pairing.
  - This avoids any central server or login.
- State/logic
  - Hotkey handler toggles “connected” state.
  - On join: open window, load iFrame with room URL/config, wait for “connected” event.
  - On leave: trigger Jitsi API’s hangup, then close window.
  - Handle idempotency: pressing hotkey rapidly won’t double‑connect or double‑leave.
- Permissions
  - macOS: add `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`; may prompt once.
  - Windows: mic/cam permissions handled at OS level, Jitsi prompts inside webview if needed.
  - Linux: varies by distro; generally works if WebRTC devices available; Wayland/X11 global shortcuts handled by Tauri plugin.
- Storage
  - Local config (partner secret, hotkeys, defaults) stored in OS app‑data directory.
  - Optional lightweight encryption-at-rest for the pairing secret.

### Non‑functional constraints
- Zero recurring cost for MVP (meet.jit.si free tier).
- No sign‑in or account.
- Fast launch: from hotkey to joined meeting in ~1–2 seconds after first run (subsequent launches faster).
- Minimal CPU/memory overhead when idle.
- Works when app is backgrounded; only tray icon visible.

### Default UX (proposed)
- First run: simple pairing screen to set partner code and hotkey combo; test camera/mic; option to auto‑start at login.
- Everyday use: press the hotkey; window appears and connects immediately; press again to end and the window closes.
- Small, clean in‑call UI (Jitsi’s built‑in controls) with optional “Mute/Camera” hotkeys.

### Edge cases to consider
- Hotkey conflicts with other apps → detect and suggest alternatives.
- App not running → if autostart is disabled, hotkey won’t work (OS limitation); recommend enabling autostart.
- Permissions not granted → show one‑time OS prompts; fallback to audio‑only if cam denied.
- Network/firewall issues → surface minimal error with retry; rely on Jitsi’s TURN/STUN.
- Both users press hotkey: fine; both land in the same room.
- Press while already in a different call: either reject or hang up current and join partner; needs a rule.
- Multi‑partner future: hotkey-per-partner model.

### Clarifying questions
- Pairing and room identity
  - Do you want exactly one partner for MVP, or multiple partners with separate hotkeys?
  - Is a shared pairing code acceptable to derive a deterministic room name (no server), or do you want us to generate and exchange a QR code within the app?
  - Do you want the room to be fixed forever (same code → same room), or rotated periodically (e.g., per‑day) for privacy?
- Hotkeys
  - What is the default 3‑key combo you want (e.g., macOS: Cmd+Shift+J; Windows: Ctrl+Alt+J)?
  - Should we reserve additional hotkeys for mute/unmute and camera toggle?
  - If the chosen combo is already taken by another app, should we auto‑fallback or ask the user to resolve?
- Call defaults
  - Should we join with mic and camera ON by default, or OFF to be polite?
  - Skip the Jitsi pre‑join screen automatically?
  - Any need for an audible chime/notification when the partner joins or leaves?
- Window behavior
  - Always‑on‑top during a call, or standard window?
  - Close the window entirely on hangup, or keep it hidden/minimized for faster re‑join?
  - Allow “Esc” to hang up?
- Background and autostart
  - Is it acceptable that the app must be running (tray) for hotkeys to work? Without running, OS can’t capture keys.
  - Should we enable “start at login” by default?
- Privacy/security
  - Is meet.jit.si acceptable for MVP (public service, no account, free), or do you prefer a self‑hosted Jitsi later?
  - Do you want E2EE enabled by default (with the usual limitations), or standard Jitsi encryption is fine?
- Naming and identity
  - Do you want to set a display name/avatar for Jitsi, or stay anonymous?
  - Do you want the app to show the partner’s name in the UI?
- Failure handling
  - If mic/cam denied, should we auto‑join audio‑only or block and prompt?
  - If network fails mid‑call, auto‑reconnect or end call?
- Platform details
  - macOS version targets (11+ okay?) and Windows (10+?), Linux target environments (X11 and Wayland)?
- Scope confirmation
  - No accounts, no backend server, no paid services for MVP—correct?
  - I’m not sure whether you want any local logs/telemetry for debugging; should we keep it off for MVP?

If you confirm or adjust the above, I’ll draft a minimal architecture and implementation plan (Tauri project structure, hotkey handling, Jitsi embed config, pairing storage) and then start building.

**User**

for MVP right now we have 1 to 1. what if we had 1 to N. like the user audience are people that frequently talk to that same group of people. lets say alex and his girlfrined frequently talk, so they are configured to each other. lets say daryl and his friend group consistently talk, then everyone in daryl's friend group is configured to the group. 

how much more would that complicate things?

also walk me through the system design from a user flow POV start to finish, in detail, what happens on system design level, for example:
user goes to website to download app, clicks download for macos -> opens dmg file -> what would they have to configure on first setup? how can we make it as seemless as possible whilst maintaining functionality? -> lets say user presses hot key -> what component of our codebase/app will that invoke to create and join a meeting with a pre-configured partner (the partner dosent have to join then they can join anytime, maybe they get a ding notification sound (something discrete)) -> user presses hotkey to disconnect -> what happens in our codebase/app that disconnects them?

thats a user based system design flow, give that to me in detail, clarifying things if needed

after we approve the system design we can build it

**Cursor**

I’ll keep this crisp and developer-focused per your preference [[memory:7595023]].

## 1→N complexity vs 1→1
- Baseline (1→1): one “primary partner,” one hotkey, one deterministic room name.
- 1→N without paging/ringing backend (MVP-friendly):
  - +Config: multiple “targets” (person or group), each with a label, code, and optional dedicated hotkey.
  - +State/logic: enforce single active call; choose default target when primary hotkey is pressed; add a simple target switcher UI.
  - +UI: settings list for targets, add/edit/remove, conflict detection for hotkeys.
  - +Storage: map of `targetId -> {label, code, hotkey?, defaults}`.
  - +Edge cases: hotkey conflicts, target not found, duplicate codes.
  - Rough complexity: +20–30% app complexity over 1→1.
- 1→N with “ring”/presence notifications (others get a ding without joining):
  - Requires some signaling or push (backend or 3rd‑party push like FCM/Web Push). meet.jit.si alone doesn’t expose presence without joining.
  - Adds auth keys, subscriptions, retry/queue, privacy, rate limiting, background listeners.
  - Rough complexity: 2× (or more) over 1→1. Still $0 is possible on free tiers, but operational overhead increases.

Recommendation: MVP supports multiple saved targets and hotkeys, but no remote paging/ring. Play a discrete ding when someone joins the room (Jitsi event). Add paging later if needed.

## System design: user flow end‑to‑end

### 0) Distribution and install
- Website detects OS and offers:
  - macOS: `.dmg` (drag to Applications). First run may need right‑click → Open due to Gatekeeper if we skip notarization initially.
  - Windows: `.exe`/MSIX installer; optional “Launch at startup” checkbox.
  - Linux: AppImage or `.deb` with `--user` install.
- First launch shows onboarding wizard.

### 1) First‑run onboarding (min friction)
- Screen 1: “Choose target type”
  - Default: Single partner.
  - Optional: Create group (1→N).
- Screen 2: “Share code”
  - Generate a short human code (e.g., `alx-dar-5s7k`) or let user type their own. Everyone in the same target uses the same code.
  - Explain: “This deterministically forms your private Jitsi room; no accounts.”
- Screen 3: “Hotkey”
  - Pre-fill OS‑sensible default (e.g., macOS: Cmd+Shift+J; Windows: Ctrl+Alt+J; Linux: Ctrl+Alt+J).
  - Detect conflicts; let user rebind; test capture.
- Screen 4: “Defaults”
  - Toggle: join with mic/cam on; always‑on‑top; start app at login.
- Save to `SettingsStore` and register the hotkey(s). Show tray icon and finish.

Data persisted (per target) in app data:
- `id`, `label`, `code`
- `hotkey` (optional; one “primary” if multiple targets)
- `joinDefaults` (mic/cam, alwaysOnTop, E2EE flag later)
Global:
- autostart, window prefs

### 2) Normal use: press hotkey to connect
- Global hotkey captured by `GlobalShortcutService` (Rust, Tauri).
- It calls `CallController.toggle(primaryTargetId)`:
  - If `Idle`:
    - Derive room: `roomId = base32(sha256(code))[:12]`, prefixed (e.g., `pair-<id>` or `grp-<id>`).
    - Create `ConferenceWindow` (Tauri window):
      - Minimal frameless or compact window; set always‑on‑top if enabled.
      - Load our webview page (`/conference.html`) with target metadata.
    - In webview, `JitsiBridge` uses Jitsi iFrame API:
      - `new JitsiMeetExternalAPI('meet.jit.si', { roomName, configOverwrite, interfaceConfigOverwrite, userInfo })`
      - Set `prejoinPageEnabled: false`, desired mic/cam state, low‑friction UI.
      - Listen to events: `videoConferenceJoined`, `videoConferenceLeft`, `participantJoined`, `participantLeft`, `readyToClose`.
    - On `videoConferenceJoined`:
      - `CallController` sets state to `InCall`.
      - Optionally play soft “connected” tick.
    - On first remote `participantJoined`:
      - Play discrete ding and optional desktop notification.
  - If `InCall`:
    - Execute `api.executeCommand('hangup')`.
    - On `videoConferenceLeft` or `readyToClose`:
      - Close `ConferenceWindow`.
      - State → `Idle`.

Notes:
- If the partner/group isn’t there yet, user stays alone in the room; when others join, Jitsi event triggers our ding.
- Rapid double‑press protection: `CallController` debounces to prevent double create/close.

### 3) Disconnect flow (same hotkey)
- Hotkey → `CallController.toggle(...)`:
  - If `InCall`: send `hangup`, destroy window, cleanup state, unregister page listeners.
  - If `Connecting`: queue a hangup once `videoConferenceJoined` arrives, or immediately `dispose` if possible.

### 4) Multi‑target (1→N) specifics
- Settings supports N saved targets.
- One “primary” target is bound to the main toggle hotkey.
- Optional: additional hotkeys (e.g., Cmd+Shift+1/2/3) mapped per target.
- If user presses a secondary target hotkey while already `InCall`:
  - Prompt policy: “End current call and join target?” or configurable “auto-switch”.
  - MVP default: reject with a brief toast if already in a call (simple and safe).
- Target switching UI (in tray menu):
  - “Join Primary”
  - Submenu: each target with “Join” (and hotkey display)
  - “Settings…”

### 5) Error/edge handling
- Permissions:
  - macOS: `NSCameraUsageDescription`, `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in Info.plist; OS prompts on first access.
  - If denied: auto‑join with audio muted/cam off; show a hint to enable later.
- Network/Firewall:
  - Jitsi handles TURN/STUN; if connection fails, show minimal retry banner.
- Hotkey conflicts:
  - Fallback to user prompt; don’t silently override system/app shortcuts.
- Multiple windows:
  - One call at a time; `CallController` enforces singleton conference window.

### 6) Components (codebase)
- `GlobalShortcutService` (Rust): register/unregister OS global hotkeys, emit events.
- `CallController` (Rust): state machine `Idle/Connecting/InCall`, opens/closes `ConferenceWindow`, lifecycle orchestration.
- `ConferenceWindow` (Rust): creates the Tauri window, passes target info to webview.
- `SettingsStore` (Rust): read/write JSON settings, encrypt pairing code at rest if we want.
- `JitsiBridge` (Webview JS):
  - Wraps Jitsi iFrame API creation, event binding, `hangup`, mic/cam toggles.
  - Sends events to Rust via Tauri `emit`, receives `hangup`/`dispose` commands.
- `TrayMenu` (Rust): quick actions (Join/Leave, Mute, Settings).
- `OnboardingWizard` (Webview): wizard UI for first run + settings.

### 7) Deterministic room derivation
- Input: `code` (short human string).
- `roomId = base32(sha256(code)).substring(0, 12)`; prefix with `pair-` or `grp-`.
- Optional privacy rotation (later): append date bucket (e.g., `-202501` monthly).
- No backend required; first entrant creates the room; others join the same.

### 8) Jitsi settings (MVP defaults)
- Domain: `meet.jit.si`.
- `prejoinPageEnabled: false`.
- `startWithAudioMuted`/`startWithVideoMuted`: user configurable.
- `disableDeepLinking: true` (keep in‑app).
- Minimal toolbar: mute, camera, hangup; hide extras for simplicity.
- Play ding on `participantJoined` (local audio asset) in addition to (or instead of) Jitsi default chime.

### 9) Packaging notes
- macOS: we can skip notarization for fastest MVP; instruct user to right‑click → Open. Later add signing/notarization.
- Windows/Linux: standard installers; enable “Start at login” if user opted in.

## Clarifications
- Targets:
  - Confirm MVP: multiple saved targets allowed, but one “primary” is bound to the main toggle hotkey?
  - Do you want secondary per‑target hotkeys now or later?
- Paging/ringing:
  - Is it acceptable that there’s no remote ring/push for MVP (ding only when someone actually joins the room)?
  - If you want paging (notify others before they join), are you okay adding a lightweight free‑tier push backend later?
- Hotkey defaults:
  - macOS default: Cmd+Shift+J; Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Alt+J — OK?
  - Reserve extra combos for mute/camera toggles now?
- Window behavior:
  - Always‑on‑top during call by default?
  - Close window entirely on hangup (fast cold start) vs hide (faster warm re‑join)?
- Privacy:
  - Fixed room per target acceptable, or rotate monthly/daily for privacy?
- Install UX:
  - Is skipping macOS notarization acceptable for MVP to avoid delays?
- Sound:
  - Prefer our own discrete ding, or rely on Jitsi’s chime?
- I’m not sure which OS versions you must support; can we target macOS 11+, Windows 10+, and mainstream Linux (X11 + Wayland)? [[memory:7595023]]

- After you confirm, I’ll produce the concrete implementation blueprint (folders, key functions, event flow) and then start building.

**User**

elaborate on an example of this:
"+Config: multiple “targets” (person or group), each with a label, code, and optional dedicated hotkey."

also, maybe dont make join/disconnect the same hotkey in case the user spams it if for example its taking too long to load.

make them default to a basic keybind (which is unique enough that they wont accidentally stumble upon it in their work flows), and customizable.



---

**Cursor**

Keeping it dense and developer-focused as you prefer [[memory:7595023]].

### Multi-target config (example)
- Each target (person or group) has: label (UI), code (shared secret to derive room), optional dedicated join hotkey, and per-target defaults.
- Global hotkeys cover: join primary target, hang up, optional per-target joins.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "settings": {
    "autostart": true,
    "alwaysOnTop": true
  },
  "keybinds": {
    "joinPrimary": "Cmd+Opt+J",
    "hangup": "Cmd+Opt+H",
    "targets": {
      "tg_alex": "Cmd+Opt+1",
      "tg_group": "Cmd+Opt+2"
    }
  },
  "targets": [
    {
      "id": "tg_alex",
      "type": "person",
      "label": "Alex",
      "code": "alx-dar-5s7k",
      "primary": true,
      "defaults": { "startAudio": true, "startVideo": true }
    },
    {
      "id": "tg_group",
      "type": "group",
      "label": "Daryl’s friends",
      "code": "daryl-friends-2ys9",
      "primary": false,
      "defaults": { "startAudio": true, "startVideo": false }
    }
  ]
}
```

- Room derivation (no backend): `roomId = "pair-" + base32(sha256(code)).slice(0, 12)`; group rooms use `"grp-"` prefix.

### Keybind model (separate join vs hangup)
- Join and hangup are different hotkeys to avoid accidental immediate disconnects if loading is slow.
- One global hangup hotkey works regardless of which target you joined.
- Optional per-target join hotkeys (e.g., join Alex, join Daryl’s group) in addition to a primary join.

### Default keybinds (customizable)
- macOS:
  - Join primary: Cmd+Opt+J
  - Hang up: Cmd+Opt+H
  - Join target N: Cmd+Opt+1..9
- Windows/Linux:
  - Join primary: Ctrl+Alt+J
  - Hang up: Ctrl+Alt+H
  - Join target N: Ctrl+Alt+1..9
- Behavior:
  - Detect conflicts on registration; if taken, prompt to rebind.
  - Let users customize all bindings in Settings; show “record shortcut” UI.

### Hotkey handling rules (anti-spam, predictable)
- State machine in `CallController`: Idle → Connecting → InCall → Disconnecting → Idle.
- Debounce: first press acquires a short lock (e.g., 1–2s); subsequent presses ignored with a small toast.
- Join while Connecting/InCall:
  - If same target: ignore (toast: “Already joining/in call”).
  - If different target: MVP default = reject with toast. (Switching can be added later.)
- Hangup while Connecting: queue hangup to run immediately after join, or dispose if safe.
- Hangup while Idle: ignore.

### End-to-end flow (what fires on join/hangup)
- Join (primary or target-specific):
  - Global hotkey → `GlobalShortcutService` → `CallController.join(targetId)`
  - `CallController` derives room from `code`, creates `ConferenceWindow` (Tauri window), passes target info.
  - Webview loads `JitsiBridge` with iFrame API pointing at `meet.jit.si` and `roomName`.
  - Events:
    - `videoConferenceJoined` → state = InCall.
    - `participantJoined` (first remote) → play discrete ding + optional notification.
- Hangup:
  - Global hotkey → `GlobalShortcutService` → `CallController.hangup()`
  - `CallController` tells `JitsiBridge` to `executeCommand('hangup')`
  - On `videoConferenceLeft | readyToClose` → close `ConferenceWindow`, state = Idle.

### Targets UI & UX
- Settings page:
  - List of targets with label, code, type, primary toggle, per-target join hotkey (optional), defaults (mic/cam).
  - Add/edit/remove targets; validate code uniqueness; show hotkey conflicts inline.
- Tray menu:
  - Join Primary
  - Join [each target] (show hotkey)
  - Hang Up
  - Settings…

### Why this design
- Keeps 1→N simple: no backend, no paging/ringing system. Everyone with the same code deterministically shares a room.
- Separate join/hangup reduces mis-press risk and race conditions under load.
- Defaults are uncommon enough to avoid accidental triggers, but still easy to chord.

### Clarifications
- Are the proposed defaults OK? macOS: Cmd+Opt+J / Cmd+Opt+H; Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Alt+J / Ctrl+Alt+H.
- MVP behavior: reject joining a different target while already in a call (toast). OK?
- Do you want per-target join hotkeys enabled by default for the first 2–3 targets, or opt-in only?
- Keep rooms fixed per target (no rotation) for MVP?

- If you approve, I’ll produce the concrete module list and event diagrams, then scaffold the Tauri app with these bindings.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "settings": {
    "autostart": true,
    "alwaysOnTop": true
  },
  "keybinds": {
    "joinPrimary": "Cmd+Opt+J",
    "hangup": "Cmd+Opt+H",
    "targets": {
      "tg_alex": "Cmd+Opt+1",
      "tg_group": "Cmd+Opt+2"
    }
  },
  "targets": [
    {
      "id": "tg_alex",
      "type": "person",
      "label": "Alex",
      "code": "alx-dar-5s7k",
      "primary": true,
      "defaults": { "startAudio": true, "startVideo": true }
    },
    {
      "id": "tg_group",
      "type": "group",
      "label": "Daryl’s friends",
      "code": "daryl-friends-2ys9",
      "primary": false,
      "defaults": { "startAudio": true, "startVideo": false }
    }
  ]
}
```

**User**

are you using an encryption algorithm?

what if different users put the same input by chance into that algorithm?

---

**Cursor**

```plaintext
roomId = 'jc-' + base32(sha256('justcall-v1|' + code)).slice(0,16)
```

### Short answer
- We’re not using “encryption” for room selection. We use a cryptographic hash to deterministically map a shared code to a Jitsi room name. Media encryption is handled by Jitsi (DTLS‑SRTP; optional E2EE is separate).
- If two different users enter the exact same code, they will join the same room by design. To avoid accidental clashes across unrelated users, we use high‑entropy codes and a namespace.

### Proposed derivation (domain‑separated hash)
```text
roomId = "jc-" + base32(sha256("justcall-v1|" + code)).slice(0, 16)
```
- “justcall‑v1” provides domain separation (prevents trivial overlap with other apps/schemes).
- 16 base32 chars ≈ 80 bits of space. Collisions between different codes are astronomically unlikely.
- If you want even lower risk, use 20 chars (≈100 bits).

### Collision scenarios
- Same input string: same room (intentional). Mitigation: use strong, app‑generated codes (not “alex”).
- Different inputs hashing to same output (hash collision): negligible at 80–100 bits for our scale.
- Unrelated users choosing the same code by chance: prevented by generating high‑entropy codes (see below).

### Code format (to prevent accidental overlaps)
- We auto‑generate a high‑entropy pairing code per target and let users share it (copy/QR). Example:
  - 20 base32 chars grouped: `f7rx-kq3m-29p8-z4nh-td8w` (≈100 bits).
  - Users can set a friendly label (“Alex”, “Daryl’s friends”); label never affects the room.
- Allow custom codes if you insist, but enforce minimum entropy (length + charset) and warn on weak codes.

### 1→N groups
- Everyone in the group uses the same high‑entropy code; they all map to the same room.
- Same derivation function; no backend required.

### Optional hardening (later)
- Add time‑bucket suffix if you want rotating rooms (privacy), e.g., monthly: `... + "-2025-08"`. Both sides must follow the same rule.
- Offer Jitsi E2EE with a passphrase (separate from the room code). That passphrase is shared out‑of‑band and never leaves the devices.

### Defaults and behavior
- Default keybinds (customizable, separate join vs hangup):
  - macOS: Join primary `Cmd+Opt+J`, Hang up `Cmd+Opt+H`, Join target N `Cmd+Opt+1..9`
  - Windows/Linux: Join primary `Ctrl+Alt+J`, Hang up `Ctrl+Alt+H`, Join target N `Ctrl+Alt+1..9`
- Strong, auto‑generated codes by default; friendly labels for humans.

### Clarify
- OK to enforce auto‑generated high‑entropy codes (with copy/QR) and treat user‑typed codes as advanced/optional?
- 16 vs 20 base32 chars for the derived room ID—do you want 16 (shorter) or 20 (extra margin)?
- Do you want E2EE passphrase support in MVP, or keep standard Jitsi encryption for now? I’m not sure how strict your privacy requirement is [[memory:7595023]].

- The above will ensure deterministic joins without sign‑in while minimizing accidental cross‑user overlaps.

- Compact recap:
  - Not encryption; cryptographic hash for room naming.
  - Same input → same room by design.
  - Use high‑entropy codes + namespace to avoid accidental overlaps; collisions from different inputs are negligible.

```plaintext
roomId = "jc-" + base32(sha256("justcall-v1|" + code)).slice(0, 16)
```

okay remember we must produce good code. the best code is the one which dosent have to be written. avoid weirdly complicated code dependencies and focus on creating a compact readable, extendable, maintainable codebase, which is not a monster to refactor if we have to change parts of it

how will you do that. you must keep that in mind whenever you write any line of code. in addition to that you must provide extremely comprehensive comments, what is important is highlighting how that code is used elsewhere. like if you change a function youmust have comments explaining what else uses that function, and stuff like that.

### How we’ll keep the code compact, readable, and easy to change
- **Start with less code (YAGNI)**: Only build the core path: settings -> hotkeys -> join/hangup. No DI containers, no global event buses beyond what Tauri already provides, no extra state libs in the webview.
- **Small modules with sharp boundaries**:
  - `GlobalShortcutService` (Rust): register/unregister global hotkeys; emit precise events.
  - `CallController` (Rust): tiny state machine (Idle/Connecting/InCall/Disconnecting) and single source of truth for call lifecycle.
  - `ConferenceWindow` (Rust): create/close Tauri window; pass target info.
  - `SettingsStore` (Rust): load/save JSON settings; minimal schema.
  - `JitsiBridge` (Webview TS): create Jitsi iFrame, bind events, expose `hangup`.
- **One way to do things**: one call path, one state machine, one settings store. No alternate flows to reduce branching.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Tauri + Jitsi iFrame + Serde + (maybe) `anyhow`. No heavy frameworks, no custom macros, no runtime plugin systems.
- **Stable internal contracts**: narrow, well-documented function signatures; prefer simple data structs over “clever” abstractions.
- **Separate join vs hangup hotkeys**: defaults uncommon enough to avoid accidental triggers; fully customizable.

### Commenting standard (cross-references are mandatory)
For every public function, type, and module, we add structured comments:
- **What and Why**: purpose, constraints, and why it exists.
- **Contract**: inputs/outputs, side-effects, invariants, error cases.
- **Used by**: explicit list of call sites (module::fn), so a change here hints where to re-test.
- **Calls**: important downstream functions to understand ripple effects.
- **Events**: which events are emitted/handled.
- **Change notes**: if you change this, verify X/Y/Z behavior.

We’ll keep comments human-like and not overly formal (some natural tone/typos as you prefer) [[memory:5375435]].

### Example: Rust function with usage map
```rust
/// join(target_id)
/// What: Start joining a conference for `target_id`. Idempotent per state.
/// Why: This is the only entry point to begin a call.
/// Contract:
/// - Inputs: `target_id` must exist in SettingsStore.
/// - Side-effects: creates a Tauri window, initializes Jitsi in webview.
/// - Errors: returns Err if already InCall with different target.
/// Used by:
/// - GlobalShortcutService::on_join_primary()  // main entry
/// - TrayMenu::on_join_target(target_id)       // tray action
/// Calls:
/// - ConferenceWindow::open(target_meta)
/// - JitsiBridge (via webview) on load -> emits "videoConferenceJoined"
/// Events:
/// - listens: "videoConferenceJoined" -> transitions Connecting -> InCall
/// - listens: "readyToClose" -> triggers cleanup
/// Change notes:
/// - If you alter state transitions, also update `hangup()` and the debounce in GlobalShortcutService.
pub fn join(&self, target_id: &str) -> Result<()> { /* ... */ }
```

### Example: Webview TS bridge with explicit contract
```ts
/**
 * createJitsi(roomName, opts)
 * What: Creates the iFrame API instance, subscribes to core events.
 * Contract:
 * - prejoin disabled; mic/cam defaults read from SettingsStore payload.
 * - emits to Rust: 'videoConferenceJoined', 'videoConferenceLeft', 'participantJoined'
 * Used by:
 * - ConferenceWindow (on DOMContentLoaded)
 * Calls:
 * - api.executeCommand('hangup') in hangup()
 * Change notes:
 * - If you change event names, update CallController event handlers.
 */
export function createJitsi(roomName: string, opts: JitsiOpts) { /* ... */ }
```

### Configuration model (targets, keybinds)
- **Targets**: list of people/groups with `id`, `label`, `code`, optional per-target join hotkey, per-target defaults.
- **Keybinds**: distinct join vs hangup. Per-target joins are optional.
- **Defaults (customizable)**:
  - macOS: Join primary `Cmd+Opt+J`, Hang up `Cmd+Opt+H`, Join target N `Cmd+Opt+1..9`
  - Windows/Linux: Join primary `Ctrl+Alt+J`, Hang up `Ctrl+Alt+H`, Join target N `Ctrl+Alt+1..9`
- **Behavior**:
  - Debounce presses for 1–2s during Connecting/Disconnecting.
  - Reject joining a different target if already InCall (toast).

### Simple, testable state machine
- States: `Idle` → `Connecting` → `InCall` → `Disconnecting` → `Idle`.
- Single owner: `CallController` holds state; all transitions go through it.
- Easy to extend (e.g., add `Reconnecting`) without touching other modules.

### Change-friendly boundaries
- Room derivation is a tiny pure function; swapping hashing or adding rotation touches one place plus the comment’s “Used by” references for re-test.
- Jitsi config isolated to `JitsiBridge`; changing toolbar, defaults, or domain doesn’t affect `CallController`.
- Hotkeys only interact with the controller, not Jitsi directly.

### Lightweight docs that won’t rot
- `docs/usage-map.md`: one-page overview of modules, their public functions, and “Used by” lists (mirrors code comments).
- File headers list the module’s purpose and “neighbors.”
- PR checklist: if you change a public fn, update its “Used by” list and `usage-map.md`.

### Logging and errors (minimal, useful)
- Use structured logs only around state transitions and lifecycle edges.
- Error messages always include the current state and target id.
- No telemetry by default.

### What I need from you to lock this in
- Confirm the separate default hotkeys above (we’ll allow customization).
- Confirm the “reject join while InCall” MVP policy.
- Confirm we should enforce auto-generated high-entropy codes (user-entered codes allowed but warned).
- Any hard preferences for comment style beyond the above? (We’ll keep them concise but comprehensive and human-like, as requested.)

- Once you confirm, I’ll produce the skeleton files with these comment templates and stubbed functions, then wire the core flow end-to-end.

- Key points:
  - Minimal modules, no unnecessary deps.
  - Single state machine controlling lifecycle.
  - Strict, human-friendly comments with “Used by/Calls/Change notes” to make refactors safe and simple.

```rust
/// join(target_id)
/// What: Start joining a conference for `target_id`. Idempotent per state.
/// Why: This is the only entry point to begin a call.
/// Contract:
/// - Inputs: `target_id` must exist in SettingsStore.
/// - Side-effects: creates a Tauri window, initializes Jitsi in webview.
/// - Errors: returns Err if already InCall with different target.
/// Used by:

/// Change notes:
/// - If you alter state transitions, also update `hangup()` and the debounce in GlobalShortcutService.
pub fn join(&self, target_id: &str) -> Result<()> { /* ... */ }
```

**User**

what is the reject join while incall?
dont worry too much about the hotkey config, thats such a small thing to worry about
yeah enforce auto generated high entropy codes, just dont allow user entered codes, its just another point of failure for the user. is that possible?

---

**Cursor**

```rust
enum CallState {
    Idle,
    Connecting,
    InCall,
    Disconnecting,
}

fn join(state: CallState) {
    // Used by
    match state {
        CallState::Idle => { /* join logic */ }
        CallState::Connecting => { /* ignore logic */ }
        CallState::InCall => { /* feedback logic */ }
        CallState::Disconnecting => { /* queuing logic */ }
    }
}

fn gen_code() {
    // Generates a code using rand
}

Keeping it concise per your preference [memory:7595023].

**Summary**
- Confirm blocking join actions during busy states.
- Enforce auto-generated codes, disallow manual input.
- Specify sharing methods via QR code or links.
- Ask if "Paste from clipboard" is acceptable.
- Outline sample code with human-like comments.
```

### What “reject join while InCall” means
- If you’re already in a call, any new “join” request (from hotkey, tray, or UI) is refused.
- UX: brief toast like “Already in a call. Hang up first.”
- Rationale: avoids accidental target switches and racey state transitions; keeps the state machine dead simple.

Behavior by state:
- Idle → join allowed.
- Connecting → all join requests ignored (same toast).
- InCall → all join requests ignored (same toast).
- Disconnecting → all join requests ignored (same toast).
- Only after returning to Idle does the next join proceed.

Minimal controller contract:
- Same-target join while busy: ignore with toast.
- Different-target join while busy: ignore with toast (no switch).
- Hangup is the one action always allowed during Connecting/InCall.

### Enforce auto‑generated high‑entropy codes (no user typing)
- Yes, fully possible. We remove all free‑text fields for codes.
- Target creation offers:
  - “Create target” → app generates a 100‑bit code (base32) and shows:
    - Copy/Share button (includes a custom URL scheme).
    - “Show QR” for camera scan.
  - “Accept invite” → app only accepts:
    - A `justcall://` invite link (OS‑registered URL scheme), or
    - A QR scan, or
    - Paste full invite payload (not raw code) from clipboard.
- No manual typing of codes anywhere. Labels are editable; codes are not.
- Deterministic room derivation is internal; the code never needs to be seen/edited after pairing.

### Small, explicit logic (illustrative)
```rust
// Rust (controller skeleton). Comments intentionally directive/human-like.
// Used by: GlobalShortcut (join/hangup), TrayMenu (join target, hangup)
// Calls: ConferenceWindow::open/close, JitsiBridge via webview events

enum CallState { Idle, Connecting, InCall, Disconnecting }

struct CallController {
	state: CallState,
	current_target: Option<String>,
}

impl CallController {
	/// join(target_id)
	/// What: Attempt to start a call for `target_id`.
	/// Rejects if not Idle (keeps life simple in v1).
	/// Used by: GlobalShortcut::on_join, TrayMenu::on_join_target
	pub fn join(&mut self, target_id: &str) -> Result<()> {
		match self.state {
			CallState::Idle => {
				self.state = CallState::Connecting;
				self.current_target = Some(target_id.to_string());
				// open window + init Jitsi (webview will emit joined/left)
				Ok(())
			}
			_ => Err(anyhow::anyhow!("busy: {:?}", self.state)), // UI shows toast: "Already in a call. Hang up first."
		}
	}

	/// hangup()
	/// What: End current call or cancel connecting.
	/// Always allowed; transitions back to Idle.
	/// Used by: GlobalShortcut::on_hangup, TrayMenu::on_hangup
	pub fn hangup(&mut self) {
		match self.state {
			CallState::Connecting | CallState::InCall => {
				self.state = CallState::Disconnecting;
				// tell JitsiBridge to hangup; on 'left/readyToClose' -> close window, set Idle
			}
			_ => { /* ignore; nothing to hang up */ }
		}
	}
}
```

Code generation and room derivation:
```rust
// Used by: Target creation (create), Invite handling (accept)
fn generate_code_base32_100b() -> String {
	// 100 bits -> 13 bytes; use 16 bytes for margin.
	use rand::RngCore;
	let mut buf = [0u8; 16];
	rand::rngs::OsRng.fill_bytes(&mut buf);
	let s = data_encoding::BASE32_NOPAD.encode(&buf);
	s[..20].to_lowercase() // 20 chars (~100 bits), grouped in UI for readability
}

// Used by: CallController when joining
fn room_id_from_code(code: &str) -> String {
	use sha2::{Digest, Sha256};
	let mut h = Sha256::new();
	h.update(b"justcall-v1|");
	h.update(code.as_bytes());
	let digest = h.finalize();
	let b32 = data_encoding::BASE32_NOPAD.encode(&digest);
	format!("jc-{}", &b32[..16].to_lowercase()) // ~80 bits room id; can bump to 20
}
```

Invite link/QR (no manual input):
- Custom URL scheme: `justcall://add?c=<code>&label=<urlenc-label>`
  - On click, app captures and stores the target; no typing.
- QR contains the same payload; “Accept invite” opens camera and imports on scan.
- Clipboard “Paste invite” expects the full `justcall://...` string (not raw code).

Why this keeps code small and safe:
- Single “busy” rule: only Idle can join. Zero queuing/switching logic in v1.
- Codes are opaque and immutable—no edit paths, no validation branches.
- Pairing is link/QR based—fewer UX errors, fewer code paths.

### Quick confirmations
- OK to enforce: join only when Idle; show toast if busy?
- OK to remove all code text inputs and rely on Create/Invite (link/QR/clipboard) only?
- Any objection to registering `justcall://` as the invite scheme?

If you confirm, I’ll lock these into the blueprint and scaffold the minimal modules accordingly, keeping comments cross-referencing where each function is used [[memory:7595023]].

- We’ll keep hotkey details light, per your note. 

- Concise recap:
  - “Reject join while InCall” = no switching; join only when Idle.
  - High‑entropy codes only; created by app; paired via link/QR; no manual typing.

yeah of course we want that reject while incall


okay now break down the project into modular steps, and each step should be testable in some way for us to monitor progress. let us start from the most granular things and build up slowly
