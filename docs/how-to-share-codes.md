# How to Share Pairing Codes Between Devices

## The Problem
Each device generates its own unique pairing code, but to connect, both devices need the SAME code.

## How to Share Codes

### Method 1: Import Button (NEW!)
1. **Device A**: 
   - Add a new target
   - Copy the generated code (click "Copy" button)
   - Share this code with Device B (via text, email, etc.)

2. **Device B**:
   - Add a new target
   - Click the **"Import"** button next to the code field
   - The field becomes editable - paste or type the code from Device A
   - Click outside or press Enter to accept
   - Save the target

### Method 2: Quick Setup
1. **Device A**: Create target with label "Partner" and copy the code
2. **Device B**: Create target with same label, import the same code
3. **Both**: Set as primary target and configure hotkeys
4. **Test**: Both press join hotkey - you'll be in the same call!

## Important Notes
- Both devices MUST use the EXACT SAME code
- The label can be different on each device
- The code determines which Jitsi room you join
- Same code = same room = connected call

## Testing Your Setup
1. Both devices: Press your join hotkey
2. You should see each other in the video call
3. Audio/video work automatically
4. Press hangup hotkey to disconnect

## Troubleshooting
- **Can't edit code field**: Click "Import" button first
- **Not connecting**: Verify both devices have identical codes
- **Hotkeys not working**: Check Settings â†’ Hotkeys tab
