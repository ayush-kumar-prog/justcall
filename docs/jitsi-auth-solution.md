# Jitsi Authentication Solution

## The Issue
When opening Jitsi meetings in the browser, some room names trigger authentication requirements. This happens with:
- Auto-generated looking room IDs (like `jc-3logflupemoqqrwi`)
- Certain patterns that Jitsi considers "private"

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Changed Room Format (Implemented)
Changed from `jc-3logflupemoqqrwi` to `JustCallRoom3logflup` which looks more like a regular meeting room.

### Solution 2: Alternative Video Services (No Auth Required)

#### Daily.co
```javascript
// Replace Jitsi URL with:
const url = `https://justcall.daily.co/${roomName}`;
```
- No authentication for public rooms
- Better WebKit support
- Free tier available

#### Whereby.com  
```javascript
// Replace Jitsi URL with:
const url = `https://justcall.whereby.com/${roomName}`;
```
- Simple, no auth for basic rooms
- Very user-friendly

#### Jami Meet
```javascript
// Replace Jitsi URL with:
const url = `https://meet.jami.net/${roomName}`;
```
- Open source, no auth required
- Jitsi alternative

### Solution 3: Once You Login to Jitsi
- The browser remembers your Jitsi login via cookies
- You won't need to login again unless you:
  - Clear browser cookies
  - Use incognito/private mode
  - Switch browsers

## About Browser Login
The login happens in your browser, not our app. It's like logging into any website - the browser remembers you.
